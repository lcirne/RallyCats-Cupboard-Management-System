## Overview
The goal of this webapp was to give food pantry volunteers a simple and easily maintained system for tracking the inventory at the food pantry. We went from a problem statement, through planning and development, and landed at a functional application in under 5 hours. In order to achieve this, my team and I started with the some foundational tools we learned in our core classes:
- Python3
- Flask
- Sqlite3
- HTML and CSS
These are tools that we were all familiar with and that we felt would suit the needs of the application. We also had in mind that once we graduated, other students or volunteers would need to maintain this system and these were the most appropriate tools we could think of that would meet our requirements and still be approachable for new undergrad students.

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. pip install flask
Once the site begins running you can login with these sample user credentials:  
Username: admin
